# NatsuMusic
A simple discord bot that helps you manage your server by providing useful commands like playing music or deleting text messages.

### Starting the application

```bash
node index.js
```

### Deploying commands

Before you can use the bots slash command you first need to add them to your Discord server. You can use the `!deploy` command to do so.
